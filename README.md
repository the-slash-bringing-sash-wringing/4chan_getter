Simply input the thread url in quotes to the get_finder function and receive a 
list containing all posts that have repeating digits or repeating two digit numbers
at the end. Also included is a list of reply posts if the post with digits replied 
to other posts. "three_nine" contains the python 3.9 compatible version, otherwise 
any version of python 3 will do.
